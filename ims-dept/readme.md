Bro try give me your feedback on this situation.

DAY 1
-----
We have a main inventory with:
Opening stock = 500 bottles.

During the day, kofi came for 300bottles for the bottling department.

The day ends with:
Closing stock = 200 bottles.

Report for the day:
OPENING STOCK => 500
CLOSING STOCK => 200
USED STOCK => 300

In the current system, the 200 is supposed to be the opening stock for the next day right?

Meanwhile, Kofi told his Dept Head he used 150 & 50 was defective out of the 300 bottles he got from the main inventory.

So Dept head inputs into the departmental inventory:
Total Stock Used: 150
Defective: 50

The question is:
what about the 150bottles left at the bottles department,
what happens to it? 
Does it have to be recorded?
If yes, how does it has to be recorded.
